Deployment Instructions for AUD, UFS and CYB Qlik Sense Applications
====================================================================

1) Create the network share where the shared application support files
   will reside.

2) Create a folder beneath it to hold the shared support files and copy
   this project folder into it.  It does not have to be called "QS_Apps".

3) In the Qlik Management Console, Import the four apps found in the 
   "Exported Apps" folder.

Note: At this time, the Extract portion of the ETL is not functional.
In the meantime, create QVD as you have previously and copy them into 
the "Source_QVDs" folder after the project folder is deployed. This is
only to support testing.

4) In the Hub, open the "Wombat Transform" app into the data load editor.

5) Create a new data connection called "Wombat Qlik Files".  It should 
   point to the parent folder of "Source_QVDs".  Go into the Qlik 
   Management Console and edit the Connection name to remove the 
   ([USER ID]) suffix.  Wait 10 minutes.

6) Once the new Connection Name is visible in the connections list, run 
   the load in the "Wombat Transform" app.  Debug any errors reported.

7) Upon successful completion, open and reload the app "Wombat AUM Schema".
   Debug any errors reported.

8) Upon successful completion, open and reload the app "Wombat Assignment 
   User Details".  Debug any errors reported.  

9) Test the app by navigating to the "App Overview" and open the sheet
   "Pick User ID".  Select a user for testing to simulate section access
   security before it is enabled (Only this user's company data will be 
   visible.  Then navigate to the "Assignment User Detail" for testing.

   Some suggested Test Users Include:
   - Test user: WOMBAT\464253  (Has Company Custom Fields) 
   - Test user: WOMBAT\462150  (Has Bar Graph values (co. 284)) 
   - Test user: WOMBAT\470108  (Has some Attempt Scores for Detail Table Chart.)

Deployment instructions for UFS and CYB will be added later as they become available.

Production deployment will have additional steps such a setting up reload tasks.
